# Pascal Projects Repository

Welcome to my **Pascal programming repository**! This repo contains Pascal programs, starting with the classic **Hello World**.

---

## Hello World Program

### Code:
```pascal
program HelloWorld;

begin
  writeln('Hello, World!');
end.
```

---

## Compilation & Execution

```

Alternatively, you can **download the ZIP** from GitHub and extract it.
